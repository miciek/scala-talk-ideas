# Scala talk ideas

This repository contains all the ideas for talks I'd wish to see during [Kraków Scala User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Krakow-Scala-User-Group) meetup. 

## Speaker training programme
The list below should be treated as inspiration. There are lots of current topics for all levels of Scala developers. 

I  want to help all the potential speakers prepare the talks. This includes preparing the agenda, slides, meeting for rehearsals and generally making sure that the speaker and the audience have great experience. 

Please let me know here or send an e-mail to [Kraków Scala User Group organizers](krakow-scala-organizers@googlegroups.com) if you'd like to participate.
